description: Verify a tenkai Rust, protocol, ontology, documentation, configuration, or workflow change with proportionate deterministic checks. Use after implementation, before review, or when a contributor needs an exact evidence report without overstating unrun tests.

# Verify Change

Run the narrowest useful checks first, then expand according to change risk.

## Procedure

1. Inspect `git status`, the diff, and the stated outcome. Preserve unrelated
   worktree changes. Use `assess-change-impact` when risk is unclear. Complete
   when every changed path is classified.
2. Run focused tests for the affected module or integration first. Add checks
   based on the surface:

   | Surface | Required evidence |
   | --- | --- |
   | Rust source | focused tests, `cargo fmt --check`, relevant Clippy/build |
   | public or multi-component behavior | affected integration test plus normal suite |
   | CLI or apply flow | focused command/parser tests plus deterministic local behavior |
   | protocol | generated build, client/example coverage, vendored compatibility review |
   | ontology or state | fresh and upgrade behavior; graph/runtime-state compatibility |
   | configuration or manifest | parsing/default tests, examples, operator documentation |
   | docs/templates/Skills | syntax, links or commands where practical; Skill validator for Skills |

3. Before ship-level handoff, run the normal repository gates unless the user
   explicitly requested a narrower check:

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo test --locked
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   ```

   Run `cargo build --locked` when packaging, feature selection, or binaries
   changed independently of tests. Complete when every applicable local gate
   has a result.
4. Keep service-dependent tests ignored unless prerequisites and credentials
   are intentionally available. Never print secrets or persist live provider
   payloads. Complete when skipped checks name both the reason and residual
   risk.
5. Review failures against the changed scope. Report pre-existing failures with
   evidence; do not relabel a failure as pre-existing without comparison.

## Output

Report:

- commands run and pass/fail result;
- focused behavior covered;
- checks skipped with reasons;
- failures and whether they block the stated outcome; and
- remaining uncertainty.

Never use “all tests pass” unless all stated tests actually ran and passed.
